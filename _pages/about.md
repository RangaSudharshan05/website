I am jointly funded by the laboratories of [Dr. Jiaqi Shi](https://medresearch.umich.edu/labs-departments/labs/shi-lab) in the Department of Pathology and  [Dr. Arvind Rao](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/) in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics.                                      
I serve as the primary bioinformatician for the Shi Lab.

In Dr. Jiaqi Shi’s lab, I study how alterations in key epigenetic regulators—specifically KMT2D and KDM6A—shape pancreatic cancer progression. As the lab’s bioinformatician, I lead the analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets to characterize how chromatin remodeling influences cellular identity, plasticity, and state transitions. This work aims to uncover the molecular mechanisms and cellular heterogeneity that drive tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance in pancreatic cancer.

In Dr. Arvind Rao’s lab, I develop computational and mathematical algorithms for biological network inference across large-scale transcriptomics data. My research applies concepts from quantum information theory and quantum computing to model biological networks — even on classical hardware. Although genes and proteins are not quantum systems, regulatory and signaling networks frequently exhibit non-local correlations, contextual behavior, and entanglement-like dependencies that resemble quantum phenomena and are difficult to capture with traditional statistical models.

A central theme of my work is the intersection between epigenomics and quantum-inspired biology.
Epigenomic regulation acts as a form of cellular decision-making, where stochastic biochemical processes (chromatin remodeling, enhancer activation, nucleosome repositioning) determine which regulatory paths a cell “chooses” within the constraints of its genomic landscape. These probabilistic transitions — influenced by chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and 3D genome architecture — mirror quantum-like principles such as superposition of potential states, context-dependent outcomes, and non-local regulatory effects. This parallel motivates the use of density matrices, partial traces, and quantum mutual information to model how cells integrate signals and commit to specific fates.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biomedical Engineering at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India in 2023.
