  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am jointly funded by the laboratories of 
    <a href="https://medresearch.umich.edu/labs-departments/labs/shi-lab">Dr. Jiaqi Shi</a> 
    in the Department of Pathology and 
    <a href="https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/">Dr. Arvind Rao</a> 
    in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. 
    I serve as the primary bioinformatician for the Shi Lab. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biomedical Engineering at IIT (BHU), Varanasi, India, in 2023.

  <h2>Research</h2>
 <p> In Dr. Jiaqi Shi’s lab, I study how alterations in key epigenetic regulators—specifically KMT2D and KDM6A—shape pancreatic cancer progression. As the lab’s bioinformatician, I lead the analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets to characterize how chromatin remodeling influences cellular identity, plasticity, and state transitions. This work aims to uncover the molecular mechanisms and cellular heterogeneity that drive tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance in pancreatic cancer.

In Dr. Arvind Rao’s lab, I develop computational and mathematical algorithms for biological network inference across large-scale transcriptomics data. My research applies concepts from quantum information theory and quantum computing to model biological networks — even on classical hardware. Although genes and proteins are not quantum systems, regulatory and signaling networks frequently exhibit non-local correlations, contextual behavior, and entanglement-like dependencies that resemble quantum phenomena and are difficult to capture with traditional statistical models.

A central theme of my work is the intersection between epigenomics and quantum-inspired biology, where epigenomic regulation functions as a form of cellular decision-making: stochastic biochemical processes such as chromatin remodeling, enhancer activation, and nucleosome repositioning probabilistically determine which regulatory paths a cell “chooses” within the constraints of its genomic landscape. These probabilistic transitions — shaped by chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and 3D genome architecture — mirror quantum-like principles including superposition of potential states, context-dependent outcomes, and non-local regulatory effects. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) provides a concrete example of this framework in action. In EMT, epithelial cells lose polarity and adhesion while acquiring mesenchymal traits such as motility and invasiveness, yet single-cell data reveal that transitions between epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid states often occur spontaneously, even without strong external stimuli. This resembles quantum tunneling, as cells traverse substantial epigenetic, transcriptional, and regulatory barriers in a probabilistic manner. Furthermore, the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal states, in which cells co-express epithelial and mesenchymal markers, conceptually parallel quantum superposition: cells transiently occupy multiple potential identities, with final outcomes influenced by local and global contextual cues such as mechanical stress or chromatin accessibility. Collectively, these observations highlight how stochastic, epigenetically regulated processes govern cell fate in a quantum-inspired, probabilistic landscape, motivating the use of tools such as density matrices, partial traces, and quantum mutual information to model how cells integrate signals and commit to specific phenotypic trajectories.
